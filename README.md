Short Messaging Services (SMS) are plagued with spam most of the time, which creates several problems such as privacy violations, security risks, and information overload. Therefore, enhancing the performance of the SMS spam detection model is necessary. For more advanced analysis of SMS content and sender behavior, many Machine Learning, Deep Learning models, and ensemble models are being used. One main drawback of existing models is the computational complexity of deep learning models and machine learning models. In this paper, we have introduced the Bayesian optimization technique in order to increase the accuracy of MNB, RF, DT, and CNN. For our experiment, a spam or ham-labeled SMS message collection dataset from Kaggle was used. Based on our experimental results, optimized CNN has an accuracy of 98.7% which is the highest when compared to other optimized models
